## **Design**

### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design ***HALPMI***.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has single method called `main` that initialises a new instance of a Manager class, and calls the `runLoop()`
method belonging to the Manager object.

[**`Assets`**](#asset-classes): Refers to a collection of classes that are the main assets of the application.

The rest of the App consists of three components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Manager`**](#manager-component): The Brain.
* [**`Helper`**](#helper-classes): Core Classes that help with operations.
  * [**`Command`**](#command): Calls all the commands.
  * [**`Parser`**](#parser): Breaks down user input into parameters accepted by the app, also checks if parameters are valid.
  * [**`Storage`**](#storage): Reads data from data files anf writes data to data files, also stores in app memory.

### UI component

### Manager component

![ManagerUML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t09-3/tp/master/docs/Diagrams/ManagerUML.png)
<br>
How the Manager class works:
* When `Duke` class instantiates a `Manager` object and calls `runLoop` method, the program will execute a while loop
* The while loop only halts when `isTerminated` boolean becomes true. The programme exits
* In the while loop, there is a switch statement. It calls a `Command/UI` method based on a commandWord
* The commandWord determines which method is called

### Helper Classes
#### `Command`

![CommandUML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t09-3/tp/master/docs/Diagrams/CommandUML.png)
How the Command class works:
* The `Manager` class calls specific methods in `Command` class
* Each method in the `Command` class would call on an `asset` class method which will manipulate the attributes inside it

#### `Parser`
The parser parses the description of the command. It first calls the validator class to validate the parameters and then returns a command.



#### `Storage`

### Asset classes


#### `Patient`

![PatientUML](diagrams/PatientUML.png)
The Patient class holds several attributes that are exposed via getter methods. To instantiate the class, all the
attributes must be given to the constructor method. There is a method to edit the attribute data that can be called
whenever user types in the correct command.

#### `Patient List`

![PatientListUML](diagrams/PatientListUML.png)
The PatientList class contains private lists of Patients and one list for searching. It has several
public methods that allows the user to get information regarding the list, view the list as well as search for specific
Patients by selected criteria.

#### `Doctor`

![DoctorUML](diagrams/DoctorUML.png)
The Doctor class holds several attributes that are exposed via getter methods. To instantiate the class, all the
attributes must be given to the constructor method. There is a method to edit the attribute data that can be called
whenever user types in the correct command.

#### `Doctor List`

![DoctorListUML](diagrams/DoctorListUML.png)
The DoctorList class contains private lists of Doctors and one list for searching. It has several
public methods that allows the user to get information regarding the list, view the list as well as search for specific
Doctors by selected criteria.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View appointments with selected criteria
This feature is a method within `AppointmentList`. `AppointmentList` contains an arraylist
of `Appointment` as a private element. `AppointmentList` methods invoked interacts with this
list, possibly making changes in the process.

Currently, `AppointmentList` has the following methods:
* `AppointmentList#add` -- Appends a new `Appointment` to the list.
* `AppointmentList#remove` -- Removes an entry from the list by appointment id.
* `AppointmentList#edit` -- Edits a existing entry from the list by.
* `AppointmentList#view` -- Text display of all or selected appointments in the list.
* `AppointmentList#find` -- Find selected appointments using the criteria given.

The methods are exposed in the `Manager#runLoop` method where user input is parsed. A `ViewAppointmentCommand` will
be returned if the user input passes the validation by `Validator`. Else, a `HalpmiException` will be thrown
indicating missing parameters.

Below is an example describing the behaviour of the `find` feature.

#### Design considerations:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Product scope

###Target user profile:

* administrator in clinic(s)
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

###Value proposition:
Manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
Streamlines the updating of data and records

Manage core clinic related data faster than using mouse or GUI.
Ensure each data type conforms to certain standards with in-built validations.

### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Version | Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ... |
|---------| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |

|         | `* * *`  | new user                                   | import or export data          | share with others when needed and make backup copies                                                                       |
|         | `* *`    | user                                       | find appointments based on selected criteria | filter out the appointments that I want to know about                                   |
|         | `* * *`  | user                                       | find a person by name          | locate details of persons without having to go through the entire list |
|         | `* *`    | user                                       | hide private contact details   | minimize chance of someone else seeing them by accident                |
|         | `*`      | user with many persons in the address book | sort persons by name           | locate a person easily                                                 |
